# Supplementary information
## Supplementary table 1
Title: Curating underlying documents for cancer drug approvals
Caption: An example curation of documents for cancer drugs approvals by the European Medicine Agencies. Documents were labeled as “relevant” or “not relevant” based on if the therapy was an oncology therapy and at least one approved indication involved a biomarker. Citations were generated and additional chosen metadata was recorded for each relevant document.

## Supplementary table 2
Title: Curating approved indications for cancer drug approvals
Caption: An example curation of 20 approved treatment indications from the US FDA. Approved indications were recorded verbatim from the originating document. The approval text was then rephrased for knowledge base use and chosen metadata of approval date and current approval status. Precision oncology concepts of biomarkers, cancer types, and therapies were also extracted as written from the approval text.
