**Fig. 2: A single regulatory approval can derive to multiple precision oncology knowledge statements**. An approved indication of Zejula (niraparib) involves two biomarkers (pathogenic or likely pathogenic germline _BRCA1/2_ variants), three cancer types (ovarian, fallopian tube, and peritoneal cancers), and one therapy (niraparib itself). This results in six separate biomarker, cancer type, and therapy relationships, each of which are derived to their own genomic knowledge statement.
