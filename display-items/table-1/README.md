# Table 1
Example statuses of curated regulatory approvals. 
| Approval status | Description |
|---|---|
| Accelerated / Conditional | The approval has received conditional authorization based on positive, albeit preliminary or incomplete, endpoints, often in underserved disease contexts.  |
| Approved | The treatment can be administered to patients based for the approved indication (‘on label’ usage). This may be a market authorization (approval for sale) or an authorization of use within a health system. |
| Superseded | The treatment indication’s text has been revised to a new version, often broadening or narrowing of eligibility criteria. For example, removing biomarker requirement(s). The earlier indication text remains historically valid but no longer current. |
| Withdrawn  | The treatment indication is no longer authorized. This may be voluntarily on behalf of the sponsor (for example, due to commercial sales) or involuntarily due to new evidence. |
